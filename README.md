# Maze_Runner

Maze Generation Algorithms from here:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm


usage:  
maze = DFS_Generation(14,40)  
BFS(maze).solve()  
print(Maze_Rep(maze))

## Next steps

I want to have a better visualization solution, printing to the console has certain limits

I want to refactor the solvers and mazes to follow the Protocols a little more closely.  

enabling printing a maze before and after solving without having to create a whole new Maze_Rep object
